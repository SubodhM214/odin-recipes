      <li>1 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 bell pepper (sliced)</li>
      <li>1 small red onion (sliced)</li>
      <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Add
        the warm water and olive oil. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough in a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with plastic
        wrap and let rise for 30-45 minutes, or until doubled in size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the dough into 8 equal-sized balls. Place them on a baking sheet
        and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Remove the baked pizza from the
        baking sheet and transfer them to a wire rack to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the
        chopped garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally. Add the
        dried oregano and basil, and cook for 1 more minute, stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic,
        oregano, and basil. Add the shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, and
        mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pizza sauce to the prepared pizza and toss gently to combine.
        Arrange the pepperoni, mushrooms, bell pepper, red onion, and fresh
        basil leaves on top, if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the pizza for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is
        melted and the crust is golden brown on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enjoy your delicious pizza! If you'd like to add more toppings, simply
        replace the sauce and cheese mixture with your desired toppings.
